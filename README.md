**Current version**
Simple Stats (data collection, Dashboard and separate Hit Counter)
Issues:

- Count goes up on each page refresh
- Collection of data fixed at 7 days needing a code change to alter.

Old Functionality:

- Only collects daily results (fixed 7 days)
- Hit counter only shows the current days hit rate.

**New enhanced version**

Fixed:
- A session for each page is started preventing constant page refreshing artificially increasing the count
- Collection Periods are all parametrised and configurable in settings

- Enhanced – Daily stats retention now has variable data retention(able to independently turn off)
- New –  Weekly stats captured for x weeks (able to independently turn off)
- New – Monthly stats captured for x months  (able to independently turn off)
- New – Page session with configurable timeout
- New – Running total of all page hits captured
- All existing Languages expanded for all changes plus some added
- Dashboard - Can change the displayed chart type within plugin settings
